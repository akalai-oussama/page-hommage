               Linus Torvalds is part of the Swedish-speaking Finns community (Finlandssvensk),a population representing 6% of Finland'sinhabitants. His father, Nils Torvalds,is a television and radio journalist and also an active member of the Swedish People's Party (the Party of Finnish Swedish-Speakers), elected MEP in 2012. His mother, Anna, is also a journalist.6,7, and his grandparents included statistician Leo TÃ¶rnqvist.8 and the poet Ole Torvalds9.

Linus' first name comes from Linus Pauling,a Nobel Prize-winningAmerican chemist, but Torvalds himself explains that he "thinks he was also named after Linus, the character of the Peanuts," which makes him "half a Nobelized chemist and half a comic book character wearing a blanket."10.

He discoveredcomputer science at the age of 11 thanks to his grandfather's computer, a Commodore VIC-2011.

               Torvalds studied at the University of Helsinki between 1988 and 199612, where he obtained a master's degree in computer science, from the NODES research group. His academic career was interrupted when he left to do his military service (compulsory in Finland). He joined theUusimaa Brigade of theFinnish Army in the summer of 1989, and served eleven months, at the rank of second lieutenant,in charge of ballistic calculations.

               When he resumed his studies in 1990, he was led to work with a DEC MicroVax computer under Ultrix,which was his first contacts with Unix.14. After the Commodore VIC-20, he used a Sinclair QLcomputer, whose operating system he modified; he writes an editor, an assembler15, and some games16 (as well as graphics libraries for Pac-Man)15.

Inspired by the Minix system developed by Andrew S. Tanenbaum,he developed an operating system kernel.17 to take full advantage of the features of its new personal computer,a compatible PC with an Intel 80386 microprocessor18. This kernel is that of the GNU/Linux operating system, under the GPL license,and constitutes his master's thesis, entitled Linux: A Portable Operating System
           </p>
           <p>After leaving theUniversity of Helsinki,he worked from February 1997 to June 2003 at Transmeta,a Silicon Valley company that manufactures microprocessors with low power consumption. At Transmeta, he was allowed to devote part of his time to the development of the Linux kernel.

               In 2003, he joined the Open Source Development Labs (integrated in 2007 into the Linux Foundation)and moved to Beaverton, Oregon (United States).20 with his family.
               
               Since then, he has focused primarily on leading the Linux kernel development team as a "Benevolent Dictator." His notoriously intransigent, frank and direct behavior, if it is mentioned as a reason for the quality of the project, nevertheless leads him to make a public apology and take a break in 201821.
               
               Unlike the majority of free softwareenthusiasts, Linus Torvalds remains relatively discreet and generally refuses to comment on the pros and cons of other operating systems, such as Microsoft's Windows system. On the other hand, it reacts vigorously when the technical qualities of the Linux kernel are questioned. His heated discussion with Andrew S. Tanenbaum, opposing the Minix and Linux kernels on a central design choice(microkernel versus monolithic kernel),remained a famous example.22.
               
               It also created in April 200523 The Gitversion control software, originally intended for the development of the Linux kernel.
               
               In September 2009,speaking at LinuxCon about Linux kernel development, he said, "We certainly don't have the lightweight, hyper-efficient kernel we envisioned when I started developing the Linux kernel."24.
               
               In 2017, at the Open Source Leadership Summit organized by Jim Zemlin, the head of the Linux Foundation,he claimed that Industry innovation discourses are [...] anyone can innovate,"think differently",it's meaningless. 99% of innovation comes from the work done [...] All this fuss is far from the actual work. The latter is measured in the details [...] successful projects are 99% sweat and 1% innovation.</p>
